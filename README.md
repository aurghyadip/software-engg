## Make Life Easier
This is th e project repository for IT693 - Software Engineering
This will be the main repository and everyoe in the group should work based on here. This will help organize the project and make coding easier.

Software engineering is not just about coding, it has a lot of project management aspect to it also. So, if someone doesn't want to actively take part in coding, he or she should help in the project manageent aspect of the said project. 

### Overview

**Pre-requisite** - For Software Engineering Lab, design a project proposal which will be used throughout the lab for performing different experiments using CASE Tools.

1. Preparation of requirement documents for proposed project in standard format.
2. Project schedule preparation using tools like MSProject. Generation of Gnatt and PERT chart from schedule. Prepare Project management Plan in standard format.
3. Draw Use Case Diagram, Class Diagram, Sequence diagram and prepare Software Design Document using tools like Rational Rose.
4. Estimate project size using Function Point(FP)/Use Case Point. Use Excel/Open office for calculation.
5. Design Test Script/Test Plan(both Black Box and WhiteBox approach) for a small component of the proposed project. Develop that component using a programming language of your choice.
6. Generate Test Result and perform defect root cause analysis using Pareto or Fishbone diagram.
7. Compute Process and Product Metrices (e.g. Defect Density, Defect Age, Productivity, Cost etc.)
8. Familiarization with any Version Control System like CVS/VSS/PVCS/Git etc.

### Make life more easier
Use the git documentation for learing git. Git is the only way to collaborate on a project as a team rather than individuals with ideas.
